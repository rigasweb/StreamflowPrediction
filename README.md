# StreamflowPrediction
This code was developed for the course of Spatial Data Analysis and Simulation Models at Utrech University. 

Frist in order to simulate efficiently the streamflow we calibrated a simulation model using the Brute Force technique. The experiments for the calibration process included the following parameters:
- **Snow melt rate**
- **Temperature lapse rate**
- **Infiltration capacity**
- **Seepage proportion**
- **Atmoshperic loss**

Then, a Random Forest (RF) was developed in order to predict streamflow, having presipitation and temperature as inputs. The predictions of the two models were compared and the analysis was extended to a new dataset to observe their variance.
